## What Is On My Mind Today?
I've been reading Nietzsche lately, so I've been considering my own place in the world a lot. Do I **worship** death? Am I not living my life to the fullest because the modern world has conditioned me to nihilism?
> "Death is close enough at hand so we do not need to be afraid of life."

Sometimes I worry that I'm subconsciously afraid of life, and that fear makes me a passive observer of my own existence. I worry that my fate is only to be hurt and to hurt others. Nietzsche believes that we should love our fate, but it's harder than it sounds.
# HOWEVER
Maybe I'm misinterpreting something. ==His writing can be a bit incomprehensible.==
Here is an unordered list of philosophers that are easier to read:
- Schopenhauer
- Descartes
- Russell
